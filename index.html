 		<p>Community Bike Project in South London
We are a new bike project collective in south London. Our aim is to make bicycle fixing and maintenance more accessible for people in our community through community run skill-shares and workshops. We are a team of bicycle mechanics with access to the tools and knowledge needed for fixing and maintaining bicycles. We have already been sharing these resources with people in our community as much as is possible but would like to create a stable space for our workshop in order to make it more accessible.
The cost of living crisis has meant many people need to chose carefully what they spend their money on. Having the option to travel for free can change peoples lives. Being able to fix and maintain your bicycle yourself is hugely empowering and can make getting on your bike achievable for so many people. Learning and sharing the skills and knowledge of bicycle maintenance through our workshops and skill-shares is also a great way to connect with your community. Its a great way to bring people together to lean and achieve something collectively. Being able to be part of a project that brings something positive to our community is a great way to strengthen our community ties. Turning cogs is a project for everyone, irrelevant of your knowledge or skills.
Encouraging cycling in our local area also helps to reduce the local air pollution levels and makes our local area a nicer place to be. Where possible we take parts from broken bikes that have been donated to us, apart from this making bike maintenance affordable, it also means we are recycling parts that may otherwise have gone to waste.
Recently Turning Cogs has been looking to set up a stable place to store our tools and spare parts, as well as a work space to work on bikes and make it easier to complete jobs that cant be done in a single session. At the moment we are hugely limited by space, we rely on the parts and tools we have scattered across our private homes. This often means a lot of time and energy is put into finding who has what parts stored where. Having a centralised space to put keep all of our tools and parts will make the project run much smoother and will allow the project to really take off.
If you, or someone you know, might have access to a suitable space for the Turning Cogs project please get in touch.</p>
